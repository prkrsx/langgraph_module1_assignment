# Module 0: Setup
1. All the necessary files have been created and keys have been setup to proceed for Module 1 learning
2. This time we are going to integrate Tavily as well and use Langgraph IDE and learn it's features in grasping more control over the agents that we build

# Module 1: Lesson 1 - Motivation
1. LLM applications follow a fixed controlled flow of event with inflexibility.
2. To create flexibility, agents were made with the capacity to decide the next step after step.
3. However, flexibility and control/reliability are inversely proportional and to make it the proportional LangGraph is used.
4. LangGraph represents flows as graphs, where nodes are tasks and edges define fixed or conditional paths.
5. This graph-based structure supports loops, branching in it's standalone LangGraph Studio IDE.
6. It integrates memory, streaming outputs, and tooling, as well as human inputs to enhance flexibility and reliability proportionality.
7. LangGraph thus enables creating Agents that can decide next steps over context and give the best of controlled and dynamic decisions.
